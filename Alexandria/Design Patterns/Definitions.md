- typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design
- general concept for solving a particular problem
- Said to be consisted of 4 main parts:
	- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
	- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
	- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
	- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

## Own definition
- Typical solution to solve **commonly occuring problems** (pattern) in **software design**, thus the name ***"Design Pattern"***

- Consist of 4 main parts:
	- **Intent**: What is/are the problem(s) are we trying to solve? Initial thoughts?
	- **Motivation**: How are we going to solve the problem? Using what we already have or something anew?
	- **Structure**: Solution to the problem, including detailed description
	- **Code example**

- Design patterns classification
	- This note following ***"Refactoring Guru"*** on how they classified patterns, specifically, by their **Intent**
	- This will cover three main groups of patterns:
		- Behavioral
		- Creational
		- Structural

> I like thinking about design pattens in terms of my classes being `people`, and the patterns are the ways that the people talk to each other. (2)
